/* Stubs for libgit2 on c-compiler (WASM).

   fallbacks create unresolved imports, plus networking transport stubs.

   forward-declared structs to get matching pointer types without pulling
   in git2.h (which the c-compiler can't parse). */

   traps. Force at least a 1 MB shadow stack for every libgit2 build. This TU is
   compiled into all libgit2 executable targets, and the linker takes the max

/* PCRE2 build configuration for the c-compiler (WASM) target.
 *
 * Upstream generates this file from deps/pcre2/config.h.in with CMake or
 * autoconf; that template is deliberately not vendored here (see
 * vendor/libgit2/README.md, "What is deliberately NOT vendored"). Until
 * ticket #473 the values arrived as -D flags in bin.json / lib.json
 * compilerArgs. A gucman `srclib` package cannot carry compiler flags —
 * validateSrclibShape accepts only `include` and `src` — so the config lives
 * here, where the in-OS `cc` and the host build read the SAME bytes.
 *
 * pcre2_internal.h defines HAVE_CONFIG_H (one recorded edit) and includes this
 * file; every PCRE2 translation unit reaches it that way.
 *
 * Every macro below was the value of a former -D flag, and every one of them
 * is load-bearing with ONE exception: removing any of them individually fails
 * the build, except PCRE2_STATIC, whose removal left byte-identical output
 * (measured by ablation at ticket #473, 2026-08-04). PCRE2_STATIC is kept
 * anyway — it is the switch upstream's export logic is written against, and
 * its inertness here is a property of this port's single-binary link model,
 * not a guarantee. The one former flag that is NOT reproduced below is
 * -DHAVE_LONG_LONG=1: it has no reference anywhere in the vendored tree and
 * its removal is likewise byte-identical, so it was cruft (README records it).
 *
 * Guards: each macro is #ifndef-guarded so a -D duplicate stays legal (the
 * "self-contained TU" rule from the freetype srclib shims).

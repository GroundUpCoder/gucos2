/*
 * snd_sdl.c — SDL queue-based audio driver for the C-to-WASM Quake
 * port. Written from scratch (not imported from upstream). Replaces
 * upstream's snd_linux.c / snd_dos.c / snd_win.c (which mmap'd a
 * kernel DMA buffer — too much OS-specific machinery for us).
 *
 * The contract with the engine is the same dma_t struct everyone else
 * fills in (see sound.h). We just back it with:
 *
 *   shm->buffer  : our own ring buffer (8 KB mono samples × 16-bit × stereo
 *                  = 32 KB). The engine's mixer (snd_mix.c) writes into this
 *                  via shm->samplepos.
 *   samples      : ring buffer total mono samples (2× actual for stereo)
 *
 * Each frame, S_Update calls SNDDMA_GetDMAPos (we tell it where the
 * play cursor is so it knows how much to advance samplepos), mixes
 * new audio into shm->buffer, then calls SNDDMA_Submit. Submit copies
 * the freshly mixed bytes out to SDL_QueueAudio for the host to play.
 *
 * Position tracking: SDL_QueueAudio is push-only — once submitted, we
 * can't observe what's still queued vs played, only the byte count
 * still pending (SDL_GetQueuedAudioSize). We compute the play cursor
 * as (total_queued - still_queued) bytes since startup, modulo the
 * ring buffer length.

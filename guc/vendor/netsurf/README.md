# NetSurf (vendored constellation) — the gucOS browser engine

The complete NetSurf browser — core plus its seven support libraries —
vendored for the gucOS toolchain (`compiler.js`).  This is the foundation
for `/bin/netsurf` (file:, data: and http(s): over the kernel HTTP
transport since #182, JavaScript on via Duktape; see `todos/OS.md` and
the netsurf lanes).  The whole constellation (~850 TUs) builds with compiler.js
in ~57 s into a ~5.0 MB wasm and runs end-to-end:
`node vendor/netsurf/smoke.mjs` builds the upstream **monkey** headless
frontend and drives a real `file://` page through
fetch → hubbub parse → libdom → libcss style → layout → plot, asserting
the plotted geometry and a clean exit.

**JavaScript is in, and on** (duktape 2.7.0 + the nsgenbind WebIDL
bindings; `todos/NETSURF-JS.md` Lane A).  DOM mutation repaints (Lane B)
and the UI event surface is real (Lane C, `todos/0289`): mouse events carry
coordinates, capture-phase listeners fire, keys reach the focused element,
and forms report input/change/submit.  `node vendor/netsurf/smoke-js.mjs`
is its gate: script execution, console, parse-time `document.write`, click
dispatch to real DOM listeners, canvas `getImageData`/`putImageData`,
`setInterval`, the 10 s execution watchdog and the `Choices` off-switch, all
driven over the monkey protocol against `demos/`.  The gucOS frontend
defaults `enable_javascript` ON; `tests/kernel/test_netsurf_js_e2e.js` is
the in-OS proof.  JS costs +2.32 MB of wasm and +30 s of build over the
JS-off configuration — see the design doc for the accepted trade.

Pinned upstream revisions: `UPSTREAM.json` (2026-02 master, NetSurf 3.12
Dev).  Licences: MIT (libs), GPLv2 (netsurf core) — each tree keeps its
`COPYING`.

## Layout

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `netsurf/` | Browser core subset: `utils/ content/ desktop/ include/ frontends/monkey/ resources/` incl. `content/handlers/javascript/{duktape,WebIDL}/` (no other frontends; `ca-bundle` + non-en locales dropped) |
| `genjs/duktape/` | **Committed** nsgenbind output — 223 `.c` + 3 headers + the two xxd'd JS blobs + nsgenbind's own source-list `Makefile`.  Regenerated only by `regen-js-bindings.sh` (needs bison ≥ 3); see "Committed generated sources" |
| `demos/` | The JavaScript acceptance pages (`hello-js.html`, `counter.html`, `sketch.html`) driven by `smoke-js.mjs` |
| `libwapcaplet/ libparserutils/ libhubbub/ libdom/ libcss/` | The parse/style stack (`include/ src/`, libdom also `bindings/hubbub/`) |
| `libnsgif/ libnsbmp/ libnsutils/` | GIF/BMP-ICO decode, small utils |
| `libnsfb/` | Framebuffer surface + 32bpp software plotters (portable subset; the gucOS frontend's raster layer — not linked by nsmonkey) |
| `gucos/` | **The gucOS frontend** (Lane 2): renders into a real gucOS window — libnsfb XBGR8888 RAM surface blitted to the SDL3-veneer window surface (same byte layout, alpha forced opaque), freetype text via a frontend-owned glyph cache (the upstream fb frontend's `font_freetype.c` minus FTC, which the vendored freetype doesn't carry), the fb frontend's scheduler, SDL input map (mouse click/drag/wheel, keys), drag-resize → synchronous reformat, SDL clipboard, per-`<title>` window titles.  `gucos/bin.json` is the app build graph (dep order rule applies; also compile-checked as `projects/netsurf-gucos`) |
| `shim/` | gucOS glue: productized `iconv` over libparserutils' charset codecs, `inet_aton/inet_pton` (address parsing only), `testament.h`, install-tree alias headers (`dom/bindings/hubbub/*`), `arpa/ netinet/` headers |
| `*/lib.json`, `netsurf-core.json`, `bin.json` | The build graph (below) |
| `patches/` | Curated content patches (table below) + `pristine.json`, the recorded sha256 of each patched file's pristine residual (what `patchcheck.mjs` checks against) |
| `update.sh`, `relativize.mjs`, `UPSTREAM.json` | Re-runnable vendor pipeline |
| `patchcheck.mjs` | Offline patch-record verifier (todos/0423): strict reverse-apply of every `patches/` section + residual manifest + per-change differential.  Runs in the `netsurf-patch` suite and the pre-commit hook; see "Updating" |
| `regen-js-bindings.sh`, `genjs-sources.mjs` | Re-runnable **binding** pipeline (maintainer-only; no build runs it) |
| `smoke.mjs`, `test/hello.html` | Build + end-to-end smoke recipe (`test/squares.html` + `test/two.html` drive the in-window e2e, `tests/kernel/test_netsurf_e2e.js`) |
| `smoke-js.mjs`, `demos/` | The JavaScript gate (17 legs incl. the A/B baselines; `--reuse` to skip a fresh link, `--leg N` for one; `test/ptr-*.html` drive the pointer-path legs) |

## Build graph & the include-order rule

Each lib has a standalone `lib.json`.  `netsurf-core.json` is the browser
core WITHOUT a frontend — deliberately a *partial* component: its TUs
compile against the constellation headers, so **an app json must dep the
libs too, and must list `netsurf-core.json` FIRST** so the core's include
dirs (`netsurf`, `netsurf/include`, …) precede the lib dirs
(`buildProject` flattens `-I`s in dep order).  The lib trees themselves
are include-order independent (relativize.mjs rewrites every
cross-component-ambiguous quote-include to an includer-relative path);
only the core keeps its upstream `"utils/…"` spellings, which is why it
must come first.  `bin.json` (the monkey smoke binary — Lane 3 may repoint this at the real /bin/netsurf app) is the reference consumer, and the run.py `projects` suite compile-checks it.

Runtime resources: the engine needs `default.css`/`quirks.css`/
`internal.css` and a `Messages` file to finish a page load (a missing
`resource:` stylesheet sends loads into the `about:fetcherror` path).
They live in `netsurf/resources/` (`Messages.en` is the committed
en split of `FatMessages`); monkey finds them via the `NETSURFRES` env
var (smoke.mjs assembles `build/netsurf-smoke/res/`), and the OS image
will seed them at `/usr/share/netsurf/` (Lane 3).  The gucOS frontend
searches `${HOME}/.netsurf/`, `${NETSURFRES}`, `/usr/local/share/netsurf/`
then `/usr/share/netsurf/`.

Fonts (gucOS frontend): generic families resolve via the `fb_face_*`
options (upstream fb names, `gucos/options.h`), then `/etc/fonts/` >
`/usr/share/fonts/` by generic filename (`sans.ttf`, `serif.ttf`,
`mono.ttf`, …); the sans default falls back to the always-baked
`mono.ttf`, so a stock image renders real freetype AA text everywhere —
seeding a proportional face (Lane 3 candidate) upgrades every family
that isn't explicitly configured.

## Patch table (all in `patches/`, applied by update.sh)

netsurf core:
- `utils/config.h` — appended `__wasm__` platform section (the `_WIN32`
  lines are the precedent): libc's `strcasestr`/`strchrnul`; upstream's
  own fallbacks for scandir/dirfd/unlinkat/fstatat/regex/utsname/mmap;
  `isascii`; `<strings.h>`.
- `content/fetch.c` — `#ifdef WITH_CURL` around the one unconditional
  curl include (upstream's curl fetcher stays excluded — gucOS
  networking is `gucos/httpfetch.c`, #182).
- `content/handlers/image/png.c` — `switch(setjmp(…))` →
  `if ((v = setjmp(…))) {} switch (v)`: compiler.js recognises setjmp
  only in if-condition form.
- `desktop/frames.c` — the only VLA in the tree → heap grids with a
  `GRID()` accessor (compiler.js has no VLAs).
- `utils/talloc.c` — `|| defined(__wasm__)` on the `__GNUC__ > 2`
  va_copy probe.
- `utils/nsoption.h` + `utils/nsoption.c` — an `nsgucos` branch in the
  per-frontend options include chain (the same 3 sites every upstream
  frontend hooks), pulling `gucos/options.h`.
- `frontends/monkey/filetype.c` — **upstream gap**: `js` is missing from
  the pre-seeded essentials mime table, and the fallback is `text/plain`,
  which `javascript_content` does not register
  (`content/handlers/javascript/content.c:115`). So an external
  `<script src="x.js">` off a `file://` page *fetched fine*, arrived as
  `CONTENT_TEXTPLAIN`, and `html/script.c`'s `select_script_handler`
  (`:49`) returned NULL — the bytes were silently discarded and the
  script never ran. Two lines seed `js`/`mjs` as `text/javascript`. Both
  frontends here share this resolver (`gucos/fetch.c:55`), so the fix is
  frontend-wide, and it holds with or without a `mime.types` file.
  Upstreamable. Regression guard: `smoke-js.mjs` leg 0 plus the
  per-demo subresource checks in legs 1-3/5-7, and
  `tests/kernel/test_netsurf_demos_e2e.js` in-window.

netsurf core — **the Lane B live re-conversion bridge** (JS DOM mutation →
re-box → reflow → repaint; design in `todos/NETSURF-JS.md`, rationale in
`logs/2026-07-26/netsurf-lane-b.md`).  Upstream converts a document to
boxes exactly ONCE, so all of this is "make box construction re-runnable
on a live content":

- `content/handlers/html/html.c` + `private.h` — `html_schedule_reconvert`
  (the one choke point, coalesced through `schedule(0, …)`), the teardown
  that clears everything pointing into the dying box tree, build-then-swap
  re-conversion, and the focus/caret re-bind across the swap.  Carries the
  build-time kill switch `-DNETSURF_NO_LIVE_RECONVERT`, which restores
  upstream behaviour — `smoke-js.mjs` leg 8 builds that variant as its A/B
  baseline.
- `content/handlers/html/dom_event.c` — schedules a re-conversion from the
  GENERIC insert/subtree-modified default actions.  libdom fires
  `DOMSubtreeModified` at the parent for insertion, removal, character
  data AND attribute changes, so one hook covers every structural class;
  STYLE keeps the stylesheet path and INPUT/TEXTAREA keep the gadget-sync
  path (a whole-document re-box per keystroke would be absurd).
- `content/handlers/css/select.{c,h}` — `nscss_node_data_clear`, a proper
  `CSS_NODE_DELETED` free of a node's cached style.  `set_libcss_node_data`
  ASSERTS it never replaces live data, so re-styling a document needs the
  cache cleared first.
- `content/handlers/html/imagemap.c` — **upstream bug**:
  `imagemap_addtolist` ran `strtok` directly on `dom_string_data(coords)`,
  writing NULs into the interned DOM attribute.  Harmless when extraction
  happens once per document; the moment it can re-run, every area collapses
  to 0,0,0,0.  Now tokenises a copy.  Upstreamable.
- `content/handlers/html/forms.c` + `private.h` — a control outside any
  `<form>` is adopted onto the content (`formless_controls`) instead of
  being owned by nobody, so it can be re-found by DOM node like any other
  gadget.  Also fixes an upstream leak: nothing freed those at destroy.
- `content/handlers/html/form.c` + `form_internal.h` —
  `form_select_clear_options` (factored out of `form_free_control`) so a
  re-boxed `<select>` refills its option list instead of appending a
  duplicate set; plus the formless-list unlink.
- `content/handlers/html/box_special.c` — call the above at select reuse.
- `content/handlers/html/box_textarea.c` — release the previous
  `textarea`/`dom_string` before rebuilding a text gadget's widget
  (upstream overwrote the pointers: one leaked widget per re-box).
- `desktop/textarea.{c,h}` — `textarea_get_caret_char`, the public inverse
  of the existing `textarea_set_caret`, so a caret can be carried from a
  destroyed widget to its replacement.  Purely additive; upstreamable.

netsurf core — **the Lane C UI event coverage** (todos/0289; rationale in
`logs/2026-07-27/netsurf-lane-c.md`).  Upstream fired exactly three UI
events at script — `click`, `keydown` and window `load` — and the first
two carried nothing useful:

- `include/netsurf/uievents.h` (new) — the build-time kill switch
  `-DNETSURF_NO_UI_EVENTS`, which restores that upstream behaviour exactly.
  `smoke-js.mjs` leg 11 builds that variant as its A/B baseline.
- `content/handlers/html/interaction.c` + `private.h` — the mouse-event
  layer: `html_dom_node_at_point` (a hit test without
  `get_mouse_action_node`'s link/gadget/scroll work),
  mousedown/mousemove/mouseup with coordinates and a `buttons` mask,
  dblclick, `click` upgraded from a plain Event to a real MouseEvent,
  keydown/keyup dispatched at the FOCUSED element instead of the document
  root, focus/blur at the one focus choke, and — the browser contract that
  makes a drawing canvas possible at all — `preventDefault()` on a
  mousedown suppressing the native page-scroll / selection drag that would
  otherwise swallow every later motion.
- `content/handlers/html/html.c` + `private.h` — `fire_dom_mouse_event` and
  `fire_dom_wheel_event` (the `fire_dom_keyboard_event` shape), the
  coordinate contract (page vs client), a cancelable `wheel` at
  `html_scroll_at_point`, and `Enter`/`Tab`/`Backspace`/`Delete` added to
  the keyboard event's special-key table — without them `event.key` was
  **null** for Enter, so "submit on Enter" could not be written.
- `content/handlers/html/form.c` + `form_internal.h` + `box_textarea.c` —
  `input` on every edit, `change` on the commit (blur, value differs from
  the value at focus), both at once for checkbox/radio/select, and the
  cancelable `submit` at the ONE choke `form_submit` shares between the
  submit button and Enter-in-a-field.  `building` guards the widget being
  seeded with its markup value, which was otherwise reported as an edit.
- `desktop/browser_window.c` + `include/netsurf/browser_window.h` —
  `browser_window_get_scroll`, so the core can turn its document-relative
  coordinates into the viewport-relative `clientX`/`clientY` the spec
  wants.  The offset is the front end's; nothing else could answer.
- `content/content_protected.h` + `content.{c,h}` + `desktop/textinput.c` +
  `include/netsurf/keypress.h` — a key RELEASE path (`keyrelease` handler,
  `content_key_release`, `browser_window_key_release`).  Upstream's own
  TODO in `interaction.c` asks for exactly this; without it `keyup` cannot
  exist, because nothing tells the core a key came up.
- `content/handlers/javascript/duktape/dukky.{c,h}` — registers BOTH phases'
  libdom listeners per (element, type) instead of only the phase the first
  JS listener asked for, so a capture listener can be invoked at all; the
  at-target phase now runs every listener whatever its capture flag (DOM
  L3); `js_fire_event` is generic instead of window-`load`-only, and runs
  the Window's OWN listeners — `window.addEventListener` used to register a
  callback nothing could ever reach; `js_event_type_registered` is the
  cheap "is anyone listening" gate that keeps a non-JS page from paying for
  a hit test per mouse motion.
- `content/handlers/javascript/duktape/EventTarget.bnd` — **upstream bug**:
  both listener-list walks indexed the CALLBACK instead of the listener
  ARRAY, so the walk fell out immediately with `idx == 0` and every
  `addEventListener` for a type already listened to on that element
  OVERWROTE the previous one (two handlers on one button ran as one; a
  capture/bubble pair collapsed to whichever was registered second), while
  `removeEventListener` never found anything to remove.  Upstreamable.
- `content/handlers/javascript/duktape/{UIEvent,MouseEvent,WheelEvent}.bnd`
  (new) + `WebIDL/uievents.idl` — MouseEvent had NO `.bnd` at all, so every
  one of its attributes was a silent no-op stub and `event.clientX` read
  `undefined`.  `pageX`/`pageY` are added to the 2015 IDL snapshot
  (standard, from CSSOM View) because this engine has neither
  `getBoundingClientRect` nor `offsetLeft` to locate an element with.
- `frontends/monkey/{dispatch.c,dispatch.h,main.c}` — **upstream bug**: the
  poll loop `select()`s on fd 0 but read with `fgets`, so one call pulled a
  whole BURST of commands into the stdio buffer, left the fd empty, and
  every command after the first was silently lost.  Invisible while each
  driver sent one command and waited for a marker; fatal for a driver
  expressing a GESTURE, whose intermediate moves have no marker.  Reads the
  fd directly now and drains buffered lines.
- `frontends/monkey/browser.c` — `WINDOW MOUSE` (any browser_mouse_state,
  by name), `WINDOW KEY … KIND DOWN|UP` and `WINDOW WHEEL`, so the cheap
  gate can drive a press-drag-release and a key release at all.

netsurf core — **the pointer path** (todos/0419 + todos/0420; rationale in
`logs/2026-07-29/netsurf-pointer-path.md`).  Both defects sit in the tail of
`html_mouse_action`:

- `include/netsurf/pointerpath.h` (new; todos/0431) — the build-time kill
  switches, one per behaviour because the merge carried two:
  `-DNETSURF_NO_CLICK_CANCEL` restores the thrown-away click-dispatch
  result (0419), `-DNETSURF_NO_DYNAMIC_PSEUDO` restores the never-match
  `:hover`/`:active` stubs (0420).  `smoke-js.mjs` legs 15 and 16 build
  those variants as their A/B baselines (legs 13 and 14 are the positive
  halves, over `test/ptr-*.html`).
- `content/handlers/html/interaction.c` — a cancelled `click` now cancels
  the clicked element's ACTIVATION BEHAVIOUR (`ACTION_SUBMIT`,
  `ACTION_NAVIGATE`, `ACTION_JS`).  The dispatch already reported the
  cancellation; upstream discarded the answer, so `preventDefault()` on a
  link did nothing and the listener's own restyle was lost with the
  document.  Same file: the `:hover` / `:active` chain subjects are tracked
  per mouse action, and a transition re-selects the box subtree of the
  topmost element whose state changed, reflows in the BACKGROUND and
  requests a redraw bounded to the boxes that really changed.
- `content/handlers/css/select.{c,h}` — `node_is_hover` and `node_is_active`
  were `\todo` stubs that always answered "no match".  They answer from the
  chain now, walking up from the subject, because a dynamic pseudo-class
  matches a chain rather than one element.  Upstreamable.
- `content/handlers/html/box_construct.{c,h}` — `box_restyle_element`, the
  bounded re-selection.  It drops libcss's per-node cache first (that cache
  holds the pseudo-class flags), re-points the boxes that alias an
  element's selection results without owning them (text boxes, a
  `BOX_INLINE_END`, a marker, a `::before` box — and an inline element's
  text boxes are its SIBLINGS, not its children), and RETIRES the replaced
  results onto the box tree's talloc context rather than destroying them,
  so the one alias shape the walk cannot reach renders stale instead of
  dangling.  "Did anything change" is pointer equality: libcss interns
  computed styles, so an unchanged selection returns the same pointer.
- `content/handlers/html/private.h` + `html.c` — the two chain subjects and
  their teardown.

libdom:
- `src/events/event_target.c` — a non-capture listener registered on the
  event TARGET fired twice per event.  `_dom_node_dispatch_event`
  (`src/core/node.c`) walks the target itself as part of both the capture
  and the bubble chains, and `_dom_event_target_dispatch`'s bubble clause
  did not exclude `evt->current == evt->target`, so the listener ran once
  at-target and again as the bubble walk passed back over the target — one
  click counted 2.  Now gated on `at_target`, which also puts a
  capture-flag listener on the target in the AT_TARGET phase where DOM L3
  wants it.  Upstreamable; also halves the duplicate work in libdom's own
  tokenlist (`classList`) and the canvas2d `DOMSubtreeModified` handlers,
  which are non-capture listeners on their own target too.  Regression
  guard: `smoke-js.mjs` leg 2 ("one click = exactly ONE increment").
- `src/events/{event.h,event.c,mouse_event.c,mouse_event.h}` +
  `include/dom/events/{event.h,mouse_event.h,mouse_multi_wheel_event.h}` —
  Lane C, all additive and upstreamable: the mouse-event CONSTRUCTORS are
  declared in the public headers (the `_dom_keyboard_event_create`
  precedent) so an embedder can synthesise one without reaching into
  libdom's private headers; `buttons` (the mask of buttons currently held)
  gains a field, a getter and a setter, because it post-dates the DOM L3
  init this class implements; and `_dom_event_is_mouse_event` tags the
  class, so a binding layer that picks a JS prototype from the event's TYPE
  NAME cannot hand MouseEvent's getters a plain `dom_event` called "click"
  and read coordinates off memory past the end of the struct.
- `src/core/{attr.c,element.c,element.h}` — an element's parsed class-name
  cache (`dom_element.classes`, what `dom_element_has_class` and so every
  class selector read) was built when a `class` attribute was ADDED and torn
  down when one was REMOVED, and never refreshed when an EXISTING one's
  VALUE changed.  So `el.className = 'slab on'` on an element that already
  had a class went on matching the OLD list for the rest of the document's
  life — `.slab.on` never applied, while the same selector on a
  freshly-created element did (todos/0316, measured in the OS).
  `dom_attr_set_value` is the one choke every value rewrite passes through
  (`setAttribute`, `className`, `classList`, `attr.value`), so it now calls
  the new `_dom_element_classes_changed`.  Upstreamable.  Regression guard:
  `tests/kernel/test_netsurf_restyle_e2e.js`.

libnsfb:
- `src/surface.h` + `src/surface/surface.c` — `NSFB_SURFACE_DEF`'s
  `__attribute__((constructor))` registration (unsupported by
  compiler.js) becomes, under `__wasm__`, an explicit registration
  entry called lazily from the surface lookup paths (the vendored
  subset ships only the ram surface).

libs:
- `libnsgif include/nsgif.h` + `libnsbmp include/libnsbmp.h` — appended
  guarded `__require_source` blocks (source-lib §4.2, tickets #464/#498):
  including the header IS the in-OS link metadata, pinned to each
  component's `lib.json` sources by the os-common require-drift gate;
  `NSGIF_NO_REQUIRE_SOURCES`/`NSBMP_NO_REQUIRE_SOURCES` are the opt-out
  hatches. Host-side builds no-op them via path-identity dedup. NOT
  upstreamable (compiler.js dialect).
- `libparserutils src/charset/codec.c` — const-correct codec handler
  table (compiler.js's strict whole-program link caught non-const extern
  decls of const definitions; upstreamable).
- `libcss src/parse/mq.c` — missing `#include <strings.h>`
  (strcasecmp; upstreamable).
- `libhubbub src/treebuilder/treebuilder.c` — the mode-trace printf is
  gated on opt-in `HUBBUB_TRACE_MODES` instead of `!NDEBUG` (gucOS keeps
  asserts live everywhere; the trace would spam stdout every parse).

The probe's compiler-bug workarounds (scrollbar.c switch→ifs, monkey
initializer→assignments, urldb.c forward decl) are **absent**: the three
compiler.js P0s they dodged are fixed (see
`tests/unit/conformance/{cg_extern_ptr_agg_init,link_static_fn_def_no_keyword,cg_switch_intmin_intmax}`),
and this build compiles the clean upstream forms — it is the integration
test for those fixes.

Also NOT patches, but gucOS-side additions made for this port:
`pread`/`pwrite` and `EILSEQ` in the compiler's libc (used by
`libnsutils/src/unistd.c` and `utils/utf8.c` + `shim/iconv.c`), and
`gucos/httpfetch.c` — the http/https scheme fetcher (#182, see
"Deliberate exclusions" above), a plain frontend TU registered through
the exported `fetcher_add()` API with zero vendored-tree edits.

## Committed generated sources

Upstream gitignores these; the vendor tree commits them (the libcss
`autogenerated_*` naming is upstream's own convention) and `update.sh`
regenerates them from the pinned sources:
- `libparserutils/src/charset/aliases.inc` (perl `make-aliases.pl`)
- `libhubbub/src/tokeniser/entities.inc` (perl `make-entities.pl`)
- `libhubbub/src/treebuilder/autogenerated-element-type.c` (gperf)
- `libcss/src/parse/properties/autogenerated_*.c` — 119 property
  parsers emitted by `gen_parser` (a C89 host tool in the libcss tree,
  built with `cc` at vendor time)
- `netsurf/resources/Messages.en` (perl `split-messages.pl` over
  `FatMessages`)
- `shim/testament.h` (hand-written, pinned to the vendored revision)

Perl generators run under `PERL_HASH_SEED=0 PERL_PERTURB_KEYS=0` —
hash-iteration order leaks into the tables, and the pin makes
regeneration at an unchanged revision byte-identical to the commit.

### The JS bindings — `genjs/duktape/` (why they are committed)

`genjs/duktape/` is nsgenbind's output over
`netsurf/content/handlers/javascript/duktape/*.bnd` +
`.../WebIDL/*.idl`: 223 `.c` (~108 KLOC), `binding.h`/`private.h`/
`prototype.h`, the two `xxd -i`'d script blobs (`generics.js.inc`,
`polyfill.js.inc`) and nsgenbind's own `Makefile` fragment, whose
`NSGENBIND_SOURCES` is the authoritative source list.

It is committed because **nsgenbind is a flex+bison tool that needs GNU
bison ≥ 3 and Apple ships 2.3**, with no package manager on the reference
machine.  Committing the output means a normal build — `smoke.mjs`,
`smoke-js.mjs`, an image bake, the run.py projects suite — needs no bison,
no flex and no nsgenbind at all.  Do NOT wire regeneration into a build
graph.  It also makes a binding edit *reviewable*: the generated diff lands
next to the `.bnd` change.

```
BISON=/path/to/bison-3.x/bin/bison vendor/netsurf/regen-js-bindings.sh
BISON=… vendor/netsurf/regen-js-bindings.sh --check   # drift gate
```

The script pins nsgenbind + buildsystem in `UPSTREAM.json`'s `tools`
section, gates on the bison version with build-it-from-source instructions,
prunes nsgenbind's `-D` debug spill (and fails loudly on any output it
cannot classify), and rewrites `netsurf-core.json`'s `genjs/duktape/*.c`
block from `NSGENBIND_SOURCES` so the two can never drift.  Verified: at the
pinned revisions regeneration reproduces every committed file
byte-identically.  Two path spellings are load-bearing, because nsgenbind
bakes the paths it is given straight into its output — outdir `duktape`
(→ the `#include "duktape/binding.h"` self-includes, resolved by `genjs`
being on the core's include list) and a `../netsurf/…` relative `.bnd`
path (→ the `#line` directives).  The script stages that exact geometry.

`netsurf/tools/xxd.c` is kept by `update.sh`'s prune whitelist for the
`.inc` step (the libcss `gen_parser` precedent: a tiny host tool built with
`cc` at vendor time).  `xxd -i` derives the array symbol from the input
path, and upstream's sed rewrites exactly one spelling of it, so that step
runs from the netsurf root with upstream's relative path.

## Updating

```
vendor/netsurf/update.sh                # clone at UPSTREAM.json pins
vendor/netsurf/update.sh --src DIR      # use existing clones
```

fetch pristine → generate → apply `patches/` → prune → `relativize.mjs`
→ install (component `lib.json`s preserved) → `relativize.mjs --check`
drift gate.  At unchanged pins the result is byte-identical to the
committed trees.  To take a new drop: bump `UPSTREAM.json`, re-run,
resolve patch fuzz, update `shim/testament.h`'s `WT_REVID`, run
`./update.sh --check` (below), then `node vendor/netsurf/smoke.mjs` must
pass.

**How the byte-identical claim is enforced (todos/0423).** Two checks, two
cadences:

- **`./update.sh --check`** is the full proof: it rebuilds the constellation
  from upstream at the pins (steps 1-5 into the stage) and diffs the stage
  against the committed trees, installing nothing — the check path never
  writes into the component trees.  It needs the network plus git, perl,
  gperf, cc and node, so it CANNOT run in the ordinary gate, which is
  offline.  It is a named manual step: **owner — the repo maintainer;
  cadence — at every `UPSTREAM.json` change and after any wholesale
  `patches/` rebuild** (both listed in the drop procedure above).  Between
  those events the claim is guarded by the offline check only.  Last full
  run: 2026-07-30, at the current pins, clean.
- **`node vendor/netsurf/patchcheck.mjs`** is the offline half, run
  continuously: by the `netsurf-patch` suite (`tests/netsurf/run.js`,
  selected by any diff under `vendor/netsurf/`) and by the pre-commit hook
  on any staged `vendor/netsurf/` change.  It reverse-applies every
  `patches/` section against the committed tree (exact context at exact
  line numbers — a fuzzy or offset apply is a failure), compares each
  pristine residual's sha256 to `patches/pristine.json`, and for any change
  to a component proves the old and new (tree, diff) pairs reduce to the
  same pristine — so a hand-edit that is not mirrored into its `.diff` in
  the same change cannot land silently (the todos/0407 incident shape).

A patch edit therefore travels as ONE change: the component tree edit, the
regenerated `patches/<c>.diff` section, and — only if the pristine base
itself moved — a `patchcheck.mjs --write-manifest` refresh of
`pristine.json`.

## Deliberate exclusions

- **curl** — `fetch.c`'s registration was already properly `#ifdef
  WITH_CURL`, and upstream's `fetchers/curl.c` stays out permanently:
  its `curl_multi`/socket/SSL-ctx surface is meaningless over the
  platform fetch stack (evaluated and rejected, ticket #182).
  **Networking itself is NOT excluded any more**: `gucos/httpfetch.c`
  (#182) registers native `http:`/`https:` fetchers over the kernel HTTP
  transport (`__http_open`/`__http_status`/`read`/`close`), registered
  from `gucos/main.c` after `netsurf_init()` — no core patch.  GET +
  urlencoded POST; redirects render the FINAL page via the #359
  `x-guc-final-url` line (`FETCH_REDIRECT` → llcache refetch).  v1
  descopes: multipart POST is a loud FETCH_ERROR (ticket #360,
  LIABILITIES L72), cookies cannot work in browser direct mode (fetch
  forbidden-header rules), no FETCH_AUTH (401 renders as content), no
  cert introspection (platform TLS).  Test:
  `tests/kernel/test_netsurf_http_e2e.js`.
- **libnslog** (flex/bison; `NETSURF_USE_NSLOG := AUTO` off is a
  supported config), **libnspsl** (cookie/networking), **libutf8proc**
  (IDN).
- **nsgenbind** — not vendored as a *tree*: its output is (see above), and
  the generator is fetched at its `UPSTREAM.json` `tools` pin only when a
  maintainer regenerates.
- **JS is NOT excluded any more.**  `javascript/none/none.c` is unlinked;
  `duktape/dukky.c` + `duktape/duktape.c` + the 223 `genjs/duktape/*.c`
  take its place, with `-DDUK_OPT_HAVE_CUSTOM_H` (upstream's own
  `CFLAGS` for this, from the duktape `Makefile` fragment the prune
  drops).  duktape 2.7.0 compiles with compiler.js **unpatched** — its two
  `setjmp` sites are both the `if (DUK_SETJMP(jb) == 0)` form the
  setjmp/longjmp lowering recognises.  Upstream's own JS surface is
  immature in ways that bound what pages can do; the audit and the
  follow-on lanes are in `todos/NETSURF-JS.md`.
- **libnsfb non-portable backends** (X11/SDL1.2/wayland/VNC/able
  surfaces, 1/24bpp depths) — gucOS renders through its own SDL3-shm
  frontend (Lane 2).
- `frontends/monkey/res/` symlink farm (upstream make furniture;
  `NETSURFRES` + `resources/` serve the same purpose here).

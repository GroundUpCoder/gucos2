// Shared engine for file-granular test suites (todos/0081).
//
// A "suite" here is a list of standalone test FILES, each an executable that
// exits 0/nonzero (the tests/kernel/*.js and tests/browser/os-*.mjs shape —
// contrast tests/run-unit.js, which runs per-TEST workers in-process). The
// engine owns everything the old dumb serial loops didn't:
//
//   - a worker pool (`jobs`) with longest-first scheduling from the previous
//     run's timings; `serial: true` entries run alone after the pool drains
//   - per-file timeout with process-GROUP kill (tests spawn os/boot.js
//     children; killing just the test process would orphan them)
//   - per-file logs under the artifact dir + an incrementally checkpointed
//     summary.json (atomic rename after EVERY completion), so an interrupted
//     session still leaves a usable partial verdict
//   - --resume (skip files that passed in the previous summary AND whose own
//     source has not changed since that pass — see staleForResume, #455),
//     --filter, --fail-fast, --timeout, -j, --list
//   - a summary that records its own SCOPE (todos/0339): `filter`, a `files`
//     block (total / selected / executed / carried / recorded) and a `runs`
//     list, and results MERGED across runs so a two-`--filter`-half sweep
//     accounts for the whole suite instead of the second half deleting the
//     first. See the selection + merge blocks in runSuite.
//
// Stale per-file logs are deliberately NOT cleared at suite start. Under the
// merge above, a carried result's `log` points at a log written by an earlier
// run; wiping the directory would leave the manifest citing files that no
// longer exist. The manifest is what makes the log dir interpretable — counting
// *.log OVERSTATES (repeat variants, prior runs), which is why the count that
// matters lives in summary.json's `files` block and not on the filesystem.
//
// Interrupt semantics (re-audited 2026-07-26). The three deaths and what
// covers each — the old note here said a SIGKILLed runner's orphans "self-exit
// when their test completes, so the only true leak is a hung test", and treated
// `pkill -f tests/kernel` as the answer. That was wrong in practice: it leaked
// 70 serve.js listeners onto the sweep's fixed ports in one round, and the next
// run then talked to those stale servers and reported reds that had nothing to
// do with the code under test.
//
//   clean exit ......... the test's own teardown; harness-temp.js rms fixtures.
//   per-file TIMEOUT ... we kill the whole process GROUP (killGroup below:
//                        SIGTERM, grace, SIGKILL). The child is detached, so it
//                        IS a group leader and the kill reaches its
//                        serve.js/Chromium grandchildren; the grace window lets
//                        a responsive child rm its own fixture dir first.
//   SIGINT/SIGTERM ..... onSignal killGroups every in-flight file, checkpoints,
//                        and exits 130 — the partial summary stays valid.
//   runner SIGKILLed ... no handler of ours can run, and the children are in a
//                        DIFFERENT group so nobody else's kill reaches them.
//                        Covered from INSIDE the child instead: every file is
//                        spawned with `-r tests/lib/parent-watch.js`, which
//                        polls its ppid and tears down its own group when we
//                        vanish. Whatever still escapes (or predates the fix)
//                        is reaped at the next run's startup by

// executes its normal list, totals agree, and the gate goes green with the new
// test never having run. `recorded == total` cannot catch it — the member list
// defines `total`, so the transform is being verified with its own key. This
// bit three times (test_punes_e2e.js, 2026-07-18; os/gcode/test/smoke.mjs;
// tests/kernel/test_win32rc.js, live on the #311 lane).
//
// This asserts SET EQUALITY between the directory and the declared list before
// anything runs: every on-disk file matching `pattern` must be a declared
// member (or a NAMED allowlist entry carrying its owner), and every declared
// member must exist on disk. Diverge → refuse to run, naming the file — the
// same fail-loud design the diff table applies to a new tools/ path
// (todos/0333), applied to suite membership. Callers with hardcoded lists
// (tests/kernel/run.js, tests/blockfs/run.js) invoke this BEFORE taking the

// ---- resume freshness (ticket #455) ----
//
// `--resume` used to skip on STATUS ALONE: a file that said `pass` in the
// previous summary was skipped, full stop — no mtime, no hash, no look at the
// file on disk. So editing a test and then "re-running with --resume to
// confirm" skipped the very file that was edited, and printed green. That is
// the same shape as the defects this estate keeps finding: a mechanism that
// reports PASS while the thing under test never executed. (The case that found
// it: test_gdi32_e2e.js on the 277-278 lane, where a `return` had shadowed a
// live check — the confirming run would have proved nothing.)
//
// The evidence of a pass is its per-file LOG, and the log path is recomputed
// here the way runOne writes it rather than read from the record's `log` field
// (that field is relative to the CWD of whichever run wrote it; the artifactDir
// is absolute and stable). A resumed result carries its ORIGINAL log forward,
// so the log's mtime keeps meaning "when this file last actually executed",
// however long the resume chain is.
//
// Returns a human-readable reason to RE-EXECUTE, or null to allow the resume:
//   - no log ............ no evidence the pass ever happened here; run it.
//   - source newer ...... the file changed since it passed; the pass is stale.
// Deliberately scoped to the member's OWN source, not its transitive read set —
// dependency-level freshness is ticket #151 and is a much heavier mechanism.
// The narrow check closes the case that actually bit, at one statSync per file.
// What that leaves open is registered (LIABILITIES L77): a member whose own
// source is untouched still resumes when a HELPER it reads has changed.

Artifacts: <artifactDir>/summary.json (checkpointed after every file) and
<artifactDir>/<file>.log (combined stdout+stderr per file).

summary.json records the run's SCOPE (todos/0339): \`filter\`, a \`files\` block
(total / selected / executed / resumed / carried / recorded) and a \`runs\` list.
Results are MERGED across runs — a suite split into two --filter halves ends up
with one record accounting for the whole suite, with each half's results tagged
by the run that measured them. \`recorded\` == \`total\` is what "the whole suite
was covered" looks like on disk.

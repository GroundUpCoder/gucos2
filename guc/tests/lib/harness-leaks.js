// tests/lib/harness-leaks.js — the harness's STARTUP pre-flight: make leaked
// resources from earlier runs VISIBLE, then reap the ones that are provably
// abandoned, before a suite starts.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. Two leaks, one family: a test run that dies abruptly leaves
// its resources behind, and both of them then FABRICATE FALSE TEST SIGNAL.
//
//   os-* fixture dirs in $TMPDIR  (tests/kernel/lib/drive.js freshImage)
//       144-197 MB each. 779 abandoned dirs = 49 GB = a 100%-full disk, which
//       presented as test TIMEOUTS and spurious failures. ENOSPC impersonating
//       a product regression.
//   orphaned serve.js listeners   (tests/browser/lib/os-harness.mjs startServer)
//       70 of them with PPID 1 in one round, squatting the sweep's FIXED
//       per-file ports. serve.js's tryListen() walks to port+1 on EADDRINUSE,
//       so the NEW server quietly moves aside while the test keeps polling the
//       fixed port and talks to the STALE one. Spurious reds with nothing to do
//       with the code under test. (serve.js --strict-port now refuses to do the
//       silent walk when the harness is the caller.)
//   os/os-system.img.tmp-<pid>    (tools/mkimage.js atomic-rename temp)
//       111 MB each, in-tree — and matched by .gitignore, so `git status` never
//       showed them. 409 MB of these had been accumulating since Jul 17 and
//       nobody saw it. THAT is why these went unnoticed: the leak was silent.
//       Everything this module finds gets PRINTED, whether or not it is reaped.
//
// THE THREE DEATHS, AND WHAT COVERS EACH. Handlers are not enough — a SIGKILL
// runs none, by definition. So the design is prevention where it can work, plus
// a retroactive sweep that needs nothing to have run at death time:
//
//   clean exit .............. harness-temp.js process-lifetime hooks; the test's
//                             own server.kill(); serve.js's parent watchdog.
//   per-file TIMEOUT ........ suite-runner already SIGKILLs the whole process
//                             GROUP (the test file is detached => group leader),
//                             which takes serve.js + Chromium with it. The temp
//                             DIR survives that (nothing runs) -> reaped here.
//   RUNNER killed from outside (the 600s call-ceiling case, and the one that
//   actually produced the 70 orphans) ... the runner's SIGINT/SIGTERM handler
//                             never runs on SIGKILL, and its children are in a
//                             DIFFERENT process group (detached), so killing the
//                             runner's group never reaches them. Two things
//                             cover it: tests/lib/parent-watch.js (preloaded into
//                             every spawned test file; notices its ppid change
//                             and SIGKILLs its own group) and, for anything that
//                             still slips through or predates the fix, this
//                             reaper on the NEXT run.
//
// SAFETY AGAINST A CONCURRENT RUN. Reaping is never "looks old" — it is
// "the owning process is DEAD":
//   - temp dirs carry their owner's pid in the name (harness-temp.mkdtempOwned);
//   - a process is reaped only when its PPID is 1, i.e. the OS itself has
//     already declared it parentless.
// A live hand-run `node tests/kernel/test_wm.js` (which takes NO heavy lock) has
// a living pid and a living parent, so nothing of its is touched. On top of
// that, callers run preflight() AFTER the heavy-lock seam (joinHeavyLock since
// #561 — the lock is then owned either by the runner itself or by its
// tests/run.js gate ancestor, which runs suites strictly sequentially), so no
// OTHER heavy suite can even be mid-flight: the lock's fail-fast (exit 3)
// happens first and this code never executes. The lock itself is untouched by
// this module.

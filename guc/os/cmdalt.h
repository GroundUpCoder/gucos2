/* cmdalt.h — command alternatives: ONE name, a switchable implementation
 * (todos/0338; design `todos/COMMAND-ALTERNATIVES.md`).
 *
 * Header-only by design, the openwith.h precedent: the image manifest's `c`
 * entries are single-source compiles, so the policy is static functions
 * shared by textual inclusion — cmdalt.c (the dispatcher + admin CLI) and
 * ctlpanel.c (the Default Programs picker) include this and must stay
 * behaviorally identical through it.
 *
 * The store is a fourth cfgstore.h store, three layers overlaid PER KEY:
 *   $HOME/.config/cmdalt   the user's pick   (ctlpanel / `cmdalt set`)
 *   /etc/cmdalt            package claims    (gucman install/remove)
 *   /usr/share/cmdalt      baked suggestion  (os/image.json)
 * Lines: KEY<ws>VALUE. KEY is a COMMAND NAME (`python`); VALUE is an argv
 * prefix whose bare first word resolves through /usr/local/bin:/bin. Two
 * reads, deliberately different:
 *   - the EFFECTIVE value is cfg_find's first match over the concat — user
 *     pick, else first package claim, else baked suggestion, so the
 *     earliest-installed implementation stays the default until the user
 *     says otherwise and a later install never silently steals the name;
 *   - the CANDIDATE set is cfg_each — EVERY line for the key, which is what
 *     the picker lists and what the not-installed error names.
 *
 * An unresolvable effective value is an ERROR, never a silent fallback to
 * another candidate: running MicroPython because the user's chosen CPython
 * is uninstalled would quietly run a script under the wrong dialect.
 *
 * A name that describes a ROLE ("what runs when you type this") is a cmdalt
 * key; a name that identifies an IMPLEMENTATION is a hard package claim
 * (project decision). `python`/`python3` are keys; `cpython-clang` is a
 * package.

/* ------------------------- the PATH-shadow diagnostic --------------------
 *
 * PATH is /usr/local/bin:/bin — user-installed binaries deliberately win
 * over baked ones (todos/0040). A package that plants /usr/local/bin/<name>
 * for a name the base image DISPATCHES therefore wins silently, and the
 * symptom is "switching the default does nothing" (never a broken command:
 * the shadow keeps running the implementation it always ran). gucman no
 * longer plants such a link — but a box that installed the package BEFORE
 * this shipped keeps it forever, because /usr/local -> /var/local is user
 * territory that an image upgrade never writes and `gucman install` has no
 * upgrade path. That population is closed at release and non-growing, so
 * this is DIAGNOSED, never auto-repaired (todos/0338 non-goals).
 *
 * INTERLOCK: the prescribed fix below (remove + reinstall) is only correct
 * once packages CLAIM command names — `commands` in the package definition,
 * appended to /etc/cmdalt by gucman install. Without that step, removing
 * the shadow leaves the key resolving to a baked suggestion the box has not
 * installed, i.e. it converts a stuck default into a `python` that exits
 * 127. Do not print this advice from a tree where gucman does not plant the

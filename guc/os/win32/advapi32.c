/* advapi32.c — the registry as a small file-backed hive (todos/0059,
 * WIN32.md friction #3).
 *
 * One text hive per user at $HOME/.win32reg (HOME=/root in-OS), loaded
 * lazily and written through on every mutation (tmp + rename, so a
 * SIGKILL mid-save never truncates the hive). Format, one record per
 * line:
 *
 *   k <keypath>                       a key with no values yet
 *   v <keypath>|<name>|<type>|<hex>   a value (data hex-encoded, so
 *                                     REG_SZ's UTF-16 bytes round-trip)
 *
 * Key paths are stored as <ROOT>\sub\key with the root abbreviated
 * (HKCU/HKLM/HKCR/HKU); lookup is case-insensitive like Windows. HKEYs
 * are heap objects holding the canonical path AND the REGSAM the open
 * asked for (#320, gap #9): there are no ACLs, so every request is
 * grantable, but a handle grants exactly what it requested —
 * KEY_QUERY_VALUE to query, KEY_SET_VALUE to set/delete a value,
 * KEY_CREATE_SUB_KEY to create a new subkey; anything else is
 * ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED. MAXIMUM_ALLOWED and the four predefined roots
 * (recognized by value) pass every check; RegOpenKeyW, the legacy no-sam
 * API, opens MAXIMUM_ALLOWED like Windows. Keys are a flat namespace (no
 * enumeration order) — exactly enough for settings-reading apps
 * (winmine's board prefs, notepad's font, calc's layout via the
 * kernel32 profile shim). RegDeleteKey/RegEnumKey grow on PORTS.md
 * demand.
 *
 * REG_OPTION_VOLATILE (#320): a volatile key — and its whole subtree,
 * a stable child is refused with ERROR_CHILD_MUST_BE_VOLATILE like
 * Windows — is memory-only. Its values read back normally in-process,
 * but nothing under it is ever written to the hive file, so it vanishes
 * with the process. The option decides at CREATE time only; reopening
 * an existing key with it changes nothing. Deliberate narrowing vs real
 * Windows: volatile keys there are machine-wide in-memory objects
 * visible to every process until reboot; this hive's only sharing
 * channel is the file, which volatile keys must never touch, so here
 * they are PER-PROCESS. No corpus app shares volatile state between
 * processes; revisit if one ever does.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 * CROSS-PROCESS SHARING — reload-merge at flush (todos/0288)
 *
 * The hive is ONE file shared by every win32 process on the system, and
 * several are live at once (winmine, notepad, calc are all seeded and
 * all write it). A flush therefore must NOT rewrite the file from the
 * snapshot this process loaded at startup — that is whole-file
 * last-writer-wins, and it silently reverts everything a peer wrote
 * while we ran (open winmine and notepad, close them in either order
 * and the second exiter used to eat the first's settings).
 *
 * So `hive_flush` RE-READS the hive and overlays only what THIS process
 * actually mutated:
 *
 *   - every value we set since load carries `dirty` and is written over
 *     its on-disk twin;
 *   - every value we deleted since load leaves a tombstone (`g_dels`)
 *     and is removed from the reloaded set;
 *   - keys are append-only here (no RegDeleteKey), so the key sets are
 *     unioned;
 *   - EVERY other record on disk survives byte-for-byte — including
 *     records for values this process merely read.
 *
 * CONFLICT RULE (decided in 0288, recorded here on purpose): when two
 * processes both dirty the SAME (key, name), the resolution is
 * **last-writer-wins per VALUE, decided at flush time** — the later
 * flush overwrites that one value and nothing else. That matches
 * Windows for an unsynchronised write pair (there is no merge to do on
 * one scalar) while making the old failure — a process reverting a
 * value it never touched — impossible. A delete is a write for this
 * purpose: our tombstone removes the value even if a peer re-created it
 * after our delete, because our delete is the later decision we hold.
 *
 * After a successful save the merged set BECOMES this process's
 * in-memory hive (dirty flags cleared, tombstones dropped), so the
 * process also picks up peer writes instead of drifting further from
 * the file with every flush. Reads are still served from that working
 * copy rather than re-reading the file per call, so a peer's brand-new
 * value becomes visible at our next flush, not instantly — settings
 * apps read at startup and write at exit, and a stat+parse per
 * RegQueryValueEx would buy nothing.
 *
 * Still deliberately not solved here (unchanged by 0288): writes since
 * the last flush are lost on SIGKILL — flushing is batched to
 * RegCloseKey/atexit so notepad's 27-value exit burst is one
 * tmp+rename, and there is no advisory lock, so two flushes landing in
 * the same instant still race on the rename (last rename wins, whole
 * file — the window is one re-read + one write, not a whole process
 * lifetime). A genuinely transactional store is `todos/0162`.
